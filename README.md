# RA
Rheumatoid arthritis RA endotype, heritatbility estimation and ppi network assesment
Figures: 
Figure 1 Conceptual overview 
Figure 2 GWAS results and heritability (pi chart – look at ways to represent heritability)  
Figure 3 Network based GWAS and have the candidate modules (summary statistics) and heritability partitioning by modules
Figure 4 Expression results – predixan and orthogonal cohort – roc curve with p-value
Figure 5 Prioritized modules – figure out how to represent the modules
